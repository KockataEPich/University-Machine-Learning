The greedy method for 0/1 Knapsack problem is not optimal, as it naively adds into the knapsack the items with the highest value by weight in decreasing order, and then completes the last addition with any item that matches the remaining available space. This approach can leave out some possibilities of arranging the items in a different manner, thus leading to a more valuable outcome.

In the case of the fractional problem, the greedy method is optimal. Because the items are already in decreasing value by weight order, the algorithm will make the best choices, and will fill up the remaining space in the knapsack with the most valuable fraction for the available space.
